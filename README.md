Note that Shutter was built while I learned Flutter and Clikelang (Dart) -> Low quality.
Shutter is an app I created around 2022/23 for my school as an volunteer project. 
After finishing a prototype I was told that it isn't possible to publish it as a school app or in relation to the school, either not by the school. 
Its confusing and disappointing that the german state doesn't support evolution by their students or even the digitalization they self failed, so this project got discontinued.

### Prototype/demo

As it is at this point the app ships these features for proven students:
- vegetarian and regular lunch plans for the cantine
- Article system as an exchange offer for students
- current kiosk & cafeteria plans
- disco song wishes or votes
- notifications about events & similar
