### Current development
After releasing the app and first updates a compulsory elective course will take work over and be the one who manage everthing.

### What is Shutter?
Shutter is application that I **created for school** because many students were disappointed that the disco on friday plays songs which they arent like.
So I decided to create a app that handles this problem with a voting system. 
But at my knowledge of Dart & Flutter grows many additional features came in my mind.

As it is at this point the app ships these features for proven students:
- vegetarian and regular lunch plans for the cantine
- Article system as an exchange offer for students
- current kiosk & cafeteria plans
- disco song wishes or votes
- notifications about events & similar

### Goal
Since the state is screwing up a lot with digitalization, i wish that shutter could improve my school and offer courses the opportunity to participate in digital structures to improve the everyday life of teachers and students. Away from the non-expandable digital resources provided by the state. (IServ, Units etc.)
